### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Seiji here, just a simple software developer that likes to learn new things ðŸ˜„.

### Some projects here that I am proud of

 * `APYS` - I did a simple rest framework in python using aiohttp, made some of my simpler web developments really easier.
  I just have some mixed feelings as I am migrating my preferences to graphQL.
 * `unicamp` - my monorepo for everything I did at uni, when I get old it might become a nostalgic repo.
 * `dotfiles` - my linux configuration dotfiles, check it out!
